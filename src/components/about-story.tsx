                For years Out Boulder County has been working to address our
                communityâ€™s need for inclusive health care. As our capacity for
                support grows so does our desire to create the change we want to
                see within Colorado.

                Our communities are struggling daily to find health care they
                feel safe in. The disparities in equitable care for LGBTQ+
                people is striking, creating perpetual issues in access and
                quality of care. With less access comes less opportunity for
                living a full life as our authentic selves.
              </p>
              <p>
                Several years ago we began our project with the completion of
                Trans Health Boulder County, a collection of providers that had
                been vetted and found competent to successfully care for our
                trans community.
              </p>
              <p>
                This foundational resource was our first step to Inclusive Care
                Colorado, as we grow this network to include all of our LGBTQ+
                identities.
              </p>

                  Health care providers complete a thorough questionnaire to
                  inform potential patients about their experience with LGBTQ
                  communities, relevant training, and inclusive practices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Provider questionnaires are reviewed by staff and published to
                  the site.
                </li>

                  Reviews from community members will be added soon to share
                  patient experiences.
